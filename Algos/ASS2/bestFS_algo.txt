The solution to Water Jug Problem in Artificial Intelligence

1. Current state = (0, 0)

2. Loop until the goal state (2, 0) reached

  – Apply a rule whose left side matches the current state

  – Set the new current state to be the resulting state

(0, 0) – Start State

(0, 3) – Rule 2, Fill the 3-liter jug

(3, 0) – Rule 9, Pour all the water from the 3-liter jug into the 4-liter jug.

(3, 3) – Rule 2, Fill the 3-liter jug

(4, 2) – Rule 7, Pour water from the 3-liter jug into the 4-liter jug until the 4-liter jug is full.

(0, 2) –  Rule 5, Empty the 4-liter jug on the ground

(2, 0) – Rule 9, Pour all the water from the 3-liter jug into the 4-liter jug.
