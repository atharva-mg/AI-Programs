Algorithm
To make a move, do the following:
View the vector (board) as a ternary number and convert it to its corresponding decimal number.
Use the computed number as an index into the move table and access the vector stored there.
The vector selected in step 2 represents the way the board will look after the move that should be made. So set board equal to that vector.


Let's start with empty board
 
 
 
Step 1:Now our board looks like 000 000 000 (tenary number) convert it into decimal no.The decimal no is 0
 Step 2:Use the computed number ie 0 as an index into the move table and access the vector stored in
New Board Position.
The new board position is 000 010 000 
Step 3:The vector selected in step 2(000 010 000 ) represents the way the board will look after the move that should be made. So set board equal to that vector.
After complete the 3rd step your board looks like\
