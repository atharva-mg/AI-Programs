Steps involved in simple hill climbing algorithm

Step 1: Evaluate the initial state, if it is goal state then return success and Stop.

Step 2: Loop Until a solution is found or there is no new operator left to apply.

Step 3: Select and apply an operator to the current state.

Step 4: Check new state:

If it is goal state, then return success and quit.

Else if it is better than the current state then assign new state as a current state.

Else if not better than the current state, then return to step2.

Step 5: Exit.


Local Maximum: Local maximum is a state which is better than its neighbor states, But not necessarily the best in the state space.

Global Maximum: This is the best solution in the entire search space, where the objective function is the maximum.

Current State: The point where we are during the search is the current state.

Flat local maximum: Where all the neighbor states of current states have the same value.

Shoulder:It is a plateau region which has an uphill edge.

Ridges and alleys: It is region which is higher than its neighborâ€™s but itself has a slope.
